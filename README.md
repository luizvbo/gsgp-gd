# gsgp-gd
Geometric semantic genetic programming with geometric dispersion operators

## Description
This project is a Java implementation of the Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming. It also includes the geometric dispersion operator, presented in the papers below.

## Instructions

### Directory structure:
* *src/edu/gsgp*: source code.
* *nbproject*: project files generated by NetBeans.
* *experiments*:
  * *data*: datasets used in the experiments.
  * *scripts*: parameter files.
* *dist*: The compiled version (jar).

### Usage

The parameter files are adjusted to work from the home directory. Thus, the folder *experiments* has to be copied to your home.
In order to execute the experiments, run the following command line:
```
	java -jar GSGP.jar -p path/to/parameter/file
```
with one of the parameter files inside the folders *bestGD* (for the experiments with GSGP+GD) and *gsgp* (for experiments without the GD operator).

### Parameters

The parameter files inside the directory *experiments/scripts* presents instructions for each parameter (presented as comments started with '**#**')
